## Project description and features
* ProjectSlipstream is a data science project. It uses vehicle lists from every (as of writing) released game in the Forza series of racing games to create a dataset. This dataset is used for data visualisation and will eventually be used to develop a public WebAPI allowing people to access and use the data.
* I made this project to gather further insights and learn more about the racing games that I enjoy playing.
